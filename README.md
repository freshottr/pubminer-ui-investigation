# PubMiner

### Running PubMiner Locally
#### Install Required Software and Tools 
 - Install `Node.jsÂ®` and `npm` (node package manager). The installer at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) will handle both of those for you
 - Install Bower globally `npm install -g bower`
 - Install the gulp command line tools globally `npm install -g gulp-cli`
 
#### Install and Build Application Dependencies
 - Ensure you are in the project directory 
 - Run `npm install` to install the server-side dependencies (`express`, `pug`, `xml-simple`, etc.)
 - Run `bower install` to install client-side dependencies (`PatternFly`, `jQuery`)
 - Run `gulp` to build `pmstyles.css` and automatically have it copied to the `public/css` folder
  
#### Start the Application
 - Ensure you are in the project directory
 - Run `npm start` to start the server on port `8081`
    - If you'd like to change the port to something different, you can modify the `bin\www` file 
    - To start in development mode, run `npm run start-dev` instead. In development mode, source changes are detected and the server automatically restarts. Also, the browser developer tools will display a Node.js icon that will allow you to debug server side code
 - In your browser, navigate to [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

### Additional Information
#### Running Integration Tests with Cypress
 - ensure the application and database are running
 - run `npm run cypress:open`
 - select `search_spec.js` from the Integration Test list. The tests should automatically start executing

#### PubMed API key
The app will recognize a PubMed API key stored as an environment variable called EUTILS_API_KEY. Alternatively, you can create a file called `.env` in the project root and store environment variables there as key/value pairs, e.g. `EUTILS_API_KEY=aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsT`. The project's `.gitignore` file is already configured to not allow check-in of `.env`.

#### Building pmstyles.css
PatternFly uses [Less](http://lesscss.org/) to compile PatternFly and Bootstrap style elements and project-specific
styles into a single .css file. The project file less\\pmstyles.less describes how the target css file is assembled, and is the place to add additional PubMiner-specific styles.

The project uses [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to compile the Less script. To build pmstyles.css, install the gulp command line tools globally `npm install -g gulp-cli`. You may also need to run `npm install` within the project folder to update the project-specific dependencies (like gulp, gulp-less and gulp-plumber). Once the dependencies are installed, you simply run `gulp` in the project folder to build pmstyles.css and automatically copy it to the \\public\\css folder.
